Hi, my name is Phil Wade and I've been building things for the web for about ten years.
Right now I'm happiest building applications on the front end with Javascript, mainly using
Angular and React, but I'm also glad to work on the backend side of things. Most of my server side
experience is with PHP, but I've worked with .NET and Python and I'm confident I can adapt to almost any
MVC framework. I'm also comfortable writing CSS and working with the ops and deployment side of the things.
