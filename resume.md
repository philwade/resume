Hi, my name is Phil Wade and I've been building things professionally on the web for ten years.
Right now I'm happiest on the front end with Javascript, using React or Angular, but I'm glad to work on the backend side of things as well.
Most of my server side experience is with PHP, but I've got experience with .NET (C#) and Python and have successfully adapted to several
MVC frameworks. I'm also comfortable writing CSS and with the ops and deployment side of the things. In my free time, I've been excited by functional programming
in general, but specifically with Elm and Haskell.

For some personal projects, please look at my github: <a href="https://github.com/philwade">github.com/philwade</a>
