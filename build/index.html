<p>Hi, my name is Phil Wade and I've been building things professionally on the web for ten years. Right now I'm happiest building applications for the front end with Javascript using React or Angular, but I'm glad to work on the backend side of things as well. Most of my server side experience is with PHP, but I've worked with .NET and Python and have successfully adapted to several MVC frameworks. I'm also comfortable writing CSS and working with on the ops and deployment side of the things. In my free time, I've been excited by functional programming with Elm and Haskell.</p>
<p>For some personal projects, please look at my github: <a href="https://github.com/philwade">github.com/philwade</a></p>
